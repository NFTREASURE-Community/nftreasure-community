### The Artist

**Thesis:** The Artist is here for the art, but also needs to keep the lights on and pay the rent. They're not just a starving artist, they're a savvy NFTREASURE hunter who knows how to monetize their talent.

**Actions:**

- **Create** as many kick-arse designs as possible and start earning commissions on sales
- **Level up** keys to earn up to 40% commission on sales of owned NFTs, because the higher the level, the more treasure.
- **Sell** NFTs when required, because sometimes you have to let go of your precious creations to make room for more.

**_Dark horse:_** An Artist that pairs up with a Marketer to drive sales. The ultimate dynamic duo, like Batman and Robin, or peanut butter and jelly. Together, they'll conquer the NFTREASURE world and make a name for themselves in the digital art scene.

### The Diamond Hand

_A Visionary NFTreasure Hunter_

**Thesis:** The Diamond Hand is a long-term thinker with an unwavering belief in the future success of NFTreasure. They're so bullish on NFTreasure becoming self-sustaining and making profits that they've convinced themselves NFTreasure will acquire Redbubble and Printify just to close their factories down, saving users from their inferior quality merchandise. This NFTreasure aficionado has even read the lengthy [360 report](https://www.360researchreports.com/enquiry/request-sample/21659278) in it's entirety. This report estimates revenue in the merchandise market will reach a staggering _US $447,164,000_ annually, with an annual growth rate of 5.83% between 2024 and 2028.

**Actions:**

- **Accumulate** as much $TRESR as possible, like a digital treasure hunter.
- **Compound** rewards into a passive income snowball that would make Warren Buffett green with envy.
- **Diamond Hand** until after the founders pool rewards are dry and NFTreasure has bootstrapped into a self-sustaining entity.
- **Passively** earn an income printing like the US Treasury from NFTreasure profits.
- **Evolve** into Vishnu of the blockchain when NFTreasure rejects a buyout offer from eBay for $1 billion.

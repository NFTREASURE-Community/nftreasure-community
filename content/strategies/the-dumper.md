### The Dumper

**Thesis:** A ruthless and profit-driven individual who doesn't care about the NFTREASURE ecosystem or its community. Their sole focus is to extract as much value from the protocol as possible, without regard for others.

**Actions:**

- **Dumps** every reward earned, ensuring they don't hold onto any assets that could potentially lose value.
- **Provides Liquidity** early on in SMRTr/AVAX and TRESr/AVAX liquidity to kickstart the project, but only to serve their own interests.
- **Optionally purchases keys** if they want to participate in the game, but only to further their profit-seeking agenda.
- **Consistently dump** the majority of their rewards, prioritizing short-term gains over long-term investment.
- **Shifts** as the SMRTr LP rewards diminish, they shift their strategy to TRESr LP, seeking the most profitable opportunities.

### The Giveaway Junkie

_Like a moth to a flame_

**Thesis:** A prize-hunting, treasure-seeking enthusiast who thrives on the thrill of winning giveaways and contests. Oxygen is optional; the rush of victory is their true sustenance.

**Actions:**

- Keeps a **keen-eye** on every NFTreasure-related tweet, with notifications on for any #NFTreasure tagged post.
- Regularly **rummages** through NFTres Intern's trash can, searching for hidden clues about upcoming Twitter giveaways and contests.
- **Always** is the first to respond to giveaway tweets and ready to open a Treasure Box at a moment's notice when new clues of prizes are announced.

### The Liquidity Provider

_The bringer of wealth_

**Thesis:** A time-constrained, long-term thinker who believes in NFTreasure's potential to become self-sustaining and profitable. Despite their busy schedule, they aim to passively accumulate $TRESR earning their rewards as a liquidity provider.

**Actions:**

- **Purchases** purchases SMRTr, TRESR, and AVAX tokens to create liquidity pairs.
- **Provides** liquidity to the SMRTr/AVAX pair, earning TRESR as rewards.
- **Provides** liquidity to the TRESR/AVAX pair, further increasing their TRESR rewards.
- **Reinvests** a percentage of rewards earned back into the TRESR/AVAX LP, compounding their earnings over time.
- **Shifts** as the SMRTr LP rewards diminish, they gradually shift their focus to the TRESr LP, maximizing their long-term gains.

Sub-classes of this strategy include:

**The Voter:** This Liquidity Provider stakes a portion of their rewards to accrue veTRESR, enabling them to participate in governance and decision-making within the NFTreasure ecosystem.

**Diamond Hands:** This Liquidity Provider maximizes the percentage of rewards reinvested into LP, compounding their liquidity into a massive pot, and demonstrating their unwavering commitment to the NFTreasure project.

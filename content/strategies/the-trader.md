### The Trader

_We're going to the moon!_

**Thesis:** A skilled chart reader and market analyst who prefers the fast-paced world of trading to the more leisurely pace of DeFi games.

**Actions:**

- **Chart Wizardry:** The Trader can decipher the hidden messages in charts like a seasoned ouija board reader, using their skills to predict market trends and make informed decisions.
- **Line Drawing Mastery:** With a keen eye for patterns, they can draw lines on charts to identify support and resistance levels, key price points, and potential breakout areas.
- **Buy Low, Sell High:** The Trader's mantra is to buy assets at a low price and sell them at a higher price, a seemingly simple strategy that requires a deep understanding of market dynamics and timing.
